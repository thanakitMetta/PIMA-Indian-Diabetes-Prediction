# PIMA-Indian-Diabetes-Prediction

This research project was a collaborative effort
involving four dedicated team members, each
contributing their unique skills and expertise towards
achieving the project's objectives. The team members
and their respective contributions are as follows:

1.1. Ms. Apinya Sriyota
- Led the planning and set the direction for the
project.
- Managed the data: from initial analysis,
choosing features, fixing outliers, to preparing
data for modeling.
- Handled the complexities of missing data,
balanced the dataset, and divided data for
training and testing.
- Built and fine-tuned the XGBoost model,
ensuring it's up to standard.

1.2. Mr. Thanakit Mettarikanon
- Collaborated on the early stages of the ANN
model, ensuring it was on the right track.
- Led the development of both the
RandomForest and Logistic Regression
models.
- Offering insights and recommendations,
helping refine our overall approach.

1.3. Ms. Isariya Kerdkla
- Took charge of building and refining the
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.
- Wrote the review of Part 1 of our report,
laying a strong foundation.
- Reviewed other models, giving feedback and
suggesting improvements.

1.4. Mr. Chanawong Karoon-ngampun
- Worked with Mr. Thanakit to start the ANN
model, setting a strong starting point.
- Built and fine-tuned the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) model.
- Supported the team by solving challenges and
providing expertise when needed
